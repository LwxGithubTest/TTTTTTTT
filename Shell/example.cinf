# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you:
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Statically compiled moduleALL hose listed by `httpd -l') do not need
# to be loaded here.
# Example:
LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so
#
Include conf.modules.d/*.conf        
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
